A quiet painting..Bob’s first seascape in the series from season 1… The paint application for this one is nice and straightforward, but for a happy result, this painting asks for thoughtfulness about placement of the different elements that make up the composition…I found myself quieting down as I painted it..almost a meditation, a centering. Love this one. 💜</p>",
